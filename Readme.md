## Delay The Inevitable (Ludum Dare 50)

A card game by [Jesse Freeman](https://twitter.com/jessefreeman) about avoiding embarrassing yourself in front of your friends. 

> We've all been in a situation where we knew it was inevitable we'd make a fool of ourselves. Now you get to relive those moments, one embarrassing match at a time.

Perform actions, match emotions, and just be silly!

### Rules

Make sure to shuffle the deck first.

1 Place deck face down
2 Take turns picking cards 
3 Do the action on the card
4 Save matching emotions
5 Win by having fewer pairs
A tie is broken by a player with less cards. Two-player games should use half the emotion pairs.

### Actions

Skip - Use to skip the next turn
Peek - Look at the top 3 cards and reorder them
Get - Another player has to give you a card
Take - You can choose which card to take from another player
Stop - Use this to stop any action
Shuffle - Shuffle the deck before the next turn

You can only hold one action card at a time. Discard when used.
